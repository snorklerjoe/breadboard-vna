# Super VNA

This is a 10MHz, 1-port VNA, built on a breadboard.  
Our design utilizes a Tayloe detector to downconvert the received reflected signal, which is different from conventional VNAs and can be much cheaper in construction. Additionally, we replace the conventionally used directional coupler with a wheatstone resistive bridge, which has been done before in the NanoVNA (a commercially-available hobbyist-grade VNA).

A schematic is available [here](./hardware/SuperVNA/schematic_sheets.pdf).
